The picture above several weeks ago at Smithville Lake. Since the lockdown, one of my family’s biggest challenges has been to keep our kids active while also being safe. We don’t have a boat to get out on the lake, but through a friend we were able to find a secluded beach where we can bring some snacks, relax in a beach chair, and float on the lake for a few hours. We’ve made it a new weekend tradition. Being on the lake has a way of slowing things down. The phone is stashed away in a dry bag, so no random notifications to pull my attention. Just laughter and sun.

As the economy gradually started opening, the trend of personal and professional development has seemingly disappeared. As I reflect on this dissipating interest, it makes sense that the normal distractions of life are what keep us from perfecting sour dough or knitting the perfect throw blanket. Life has a way…

At the beginning of the year, I set a few goals for myself. All very basic and necessary. First goal was to update all professional documents. It’s been years since my last resume update and if you click on my LinkedIn, you’ll see that it currently shows my job title from 2017. Second goal was to set up this site. My thinking was that I needed to start recording my thoughts and learnings. My final goal was to improve my R skills by taking part in things like #TidyTuesday. It seems like a lot of the people that start taking part in this weekly event end up receiving valuable suggestions and it’s also a way of connecting to a community that is very helpful and encouraging.

Here I am mid-August without even starting on these things. I’m not sure what I’ll add to this site in the future but for now, the site is live. I’ve looked at a few solutions to store my resume in Google Sheets and formatting in R, so I’ll probably make that work into another post here.

## Organizing Life

Point of this blog is to organize my professional life, record things I’m learning, and have a format to post about personal adventures. There are a lot of things that I still have to do on the professional side:

1.	~~Serve site to Netlify~~
2.	~~Setup Google domain~~
3.	Update Linkedin–it’s a bit embarrassing how out of date I’ve let this get
4.	Update resume–should go hand in hand with Linkedin update

I’d like to write about our family vacations and some of my running adventures. I’ll probably try building some visuals in R based on Strava runs.

Overall, this is an opportunity to build my written communication skills. Anyway, we’ll see how this goes.

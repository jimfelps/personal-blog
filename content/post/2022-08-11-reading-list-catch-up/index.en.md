It’s been a long time since I last wrote. I actually think I’ve typed up one or two notes on stories I've read but have not published to the blog. I sometimes go through brief periods where I spend the majority of free time reading. In those periods, I'm usually reading easier books like biographies and business books on topics I've  taken notes previously. I read Numbers and Narratives by Aswath Damodaran, which was an interesting addition to the concepts in Expectations Investing (Mauboussin and Rappaport). It was fun to think about the importance of understanding a business through story form to help paint a more informed and (hopefully) a better outcome on forecasting.

I'm currently reading The Fish that Ate the Whale by Rich Cohen and I feel compelled to learn and write about Sam Zemurray (main character) and Lee Christmas (support staff). This book has a lot of interesting stories that help show Sam the Banana man playing the role of the  disruptor in the early 19th century *late 19th/early 20th(?)*. Then a story about the formation of United Fruit as part of the gilded age trusts*(?)* and how they came to be though legitimate, albeit somewhat shady transactions. 

The story of Zemurray is an interesting parallel to disruptive start ups today. United Fruit was a large and faceless corporation that was slow to change while Cuyamel Fruit (Zemurray's company) was significantly smaller but had the character that only a small start-up can have, which also gave Sam a positive reputation on the island. The mature company can be seen as taking a turn for the worse when the founders retire or die, and a second generation takes control. A generation that didn't grow the business and, therefore, didn't experience the hardships of creating something great.

Cuyamel was also innovating, bringing overhead irrigation to a region that had 200+ inches of rain per year, improved drainage to river valleys that already provided good natural drainage, selective pruning, and staking with bamboo sticks to prevent wind damage. A lot of these innovations would not seem obvious to even seasoned 'banana men', but Sam Zemurray was constantly on the ground and had performed every single job in the industry. Before the term was ever thought, he had an anti-fragile mindset--life is just a series of problems to be solved and everywhere we look are data points that help us discover ways to solve them. 

I'm reminded of Jim McKelvy's book, The Innovation Stack, while I read this story about Sam the Banana Man. This anti-fragile mindset of Zemurray is the key to Cuyamel building impenetrable longterm moats. Solving the most difficult problems are the reason hundreds of other banana companies failed to register as a threat to United Fruit. He would go as far as funding a revolution in Honduras to protect his banana kingdom. For better or for worse, Zemurray saw a threat to his business and found a solution. No length was too far. 

The book has everything I love: an interesting story about market creation, business strategy (especially when business strategy goes wrong), a larger than life story about an individual or group that explores their life(s) in detail. I think it's a super interesting book that I'll have more thoughts to write about once I'm done.

Links to stories that I'm reading and found interesting. I try to take some notes and form some sort of original opinion based on what I learned from the piece. I find this helps me understand the topic, especially when I'm reading something deeply technical.

## [China - trouble on the horizon](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-14/is-china-stumbling-into-its-own-mortgage-crisis?sref=ZtdQlmKR)

I generally think economic data from China is suspect, so this bias informs my general feeling of concern over this story. In addition to this story, we received data this past week that China’s GDP growth was slower than expected, meaning their full year growth target will be closer to 3.5% vs the 5.5% target. If a slow down in China is bad for the entire world, what would an economic collapse mean?

China has a serious problem in the property sector. Homebuyers in China are refusing to make loan payments for homes they have purchased but developers failed to complete. It seems as though developers are strapped for cash as they struggle to pay their own loan payments. The largest is Evergrande, which made headlines in late 2021 when they defaulted on one loan. If borrowers refuse to repay loans on housing that has not, and maybe will not, be completed, there is real risk to the banking sector and the government has not been public about a plan to backstop banks. 

“According to Autonomous Research, banks have about 62 trillion yuan ($9.2 trillion) of exposure to the property sector. More than half is in the form of mortgage loans.” Only about 5 trillion yuan is non-mortgage debt (meaning the total mortgage debt in China is ~$8.4T). [US mortgage debt in 2008 was about 67% higher](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274636/combined-sum-of-all-holders-of-mortgage-debt-outstanding-in-the-us/), but the size of debt in China is large and could mean major problems if they start to experience widespread defaults.

The problem is widespread among Chinese developers, with over a quarter of the top 100 defaulting or asking creditors for extensions. To further compound their cash flow problems, property sales have decreased 72% from last year as the overall economy appears to be contracting. 

## [US Inflation—pessimistic opinion](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-14/what-it-will-take-for-the-fed-to-tame-inflation)

Bill Dudley thinks that the Fed must cause a recession to get inflation under control. When I discuss this possibility with friends it’s usually met with disgust at the idea that someone could be so flippant with people’s livelihoods.Dudley presents a case for why some mild pain in the short term could prevent a long term catastrophe. Discussing recessions with people my age evokes thoughts of GFC-level pain, so it’s understandable that a 35 year old is skeptical of minor economic pain when discussing a recession. 

While one might think that the current wave of economic data indicates a soft landing—June employment report, ISM index, falling energy prices, declining wage inflation, and longer-term inflation exceptions remaining anchored. Dudley presents his case that inflation is not decelerating.

1. There’s still excess demand for workers. Nearly 2 job openings for every unemployed worker. This will need to come down significantly to push inflation back to 2%, which would almost certainly cause a recession.
2. The Fed needs to learn from the mistake of the 60’s and 70’s where the Fed was too quick to loosen monetary policy which resulted in a much deeper recession in the late 70’s. Essentially saying that inflationary pressures today are quite strong and the only way to control future inflationary pressures is a a demand shock—mild recession today. 
3. Higher interest rates caused by monetary tightening will generate operating losses for the Fed (higher interest paid on bank reserves will far outweigh the interest collected on its treasury and mortgage holdings), which will be at the taxpayers expense and opponents of quantitative easing could argue that this breaches the boundary between fiscal and monetary policy, leading to Congress taking away this tool—a major blow to providing monetary stimulus in future downturns. 

Dudley presents a challenging future for the Fed. The possibility of Congress taking away regulatory tool such as QE is interesting but ultimately I think that members of Congress, no matter how they talk in public, prefer to have the Fed pulling the economic strings so there’s always someone else to blame when the economy goes south. I couldn’t imagine a world where Congress actually employed tax hikes to control inflation.

## [US Inflation—optimism in the data](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-14/fed-s-inflation-fight-gets-a-boost-from-the-labor-market?sref=ZtdQlmKR)

Conor Sen provides a more rosy picture of our economic future in the US by analyzing the labor market, arguing that wage growth in the labor market was always the most uncertain aspect to moderating future inflation without a recession. This opinion is almost the antithesis to Bill Dudley’s piece above, with Sen arguing that moderating wage growth in the hottest portions of the economy is the final sign of moderating inflation now that cars, freight, and commodity prices have all started moderating. 

The crux of Sen’s argument is that while 2021 saw record wage growth, 2022 wages have stagnated in nominal terms and decreased significantly in real terms but we haven’t seen net layoffs. The 2022 rebalancing is continued employment growth with declining real wage growth as the market finds new equilibrium. 

But just as double digit wage growth shouldn’t be seen as normal, stagnant wage growth shouldn’t be expected to persist. Inflation anxiety in Sen’s context makes a lot of sense to me. Finding the new equilibrium has been painful for employers for over a year now, while workers feel the pain of rising prices and stagnant wages in 2022.

## [Car loan defaults on the rise](https://www.barrons.com/articles/recession-cars-bank-repos-51657316562?mod=article_signInButton)

My family frequently makes trips across the entire city to visit friends and family and in 2021, I started noticing that a lot of cars had temp tags, which made sense considering how many people bought autos during the pandemic. On the 1.5 hour round trip, we found ourselves counting the number of temp tags and what proportion of those tags were expired and it averaged around 7-10 total tags *each way* by fall and about half of which were expired, a ratio that we thought had increased throughout the year. I initially thought the increase in expiration was a sign of financial stress with people avoiding paying sales tax on their vehicles but my wife discovered that police in our city were not enforcing expired tags during the pandemic and [only recently started enforcing](https://www.kmbc.com/article/missouri-expired-temporary-license-tags-vehicles-tax-insurance/39991660) (today we see a lot fewer tags which could be from increased enforcement or a sign of a slowdown in purchases).

I was interested in this article primarily because of our family car ride activity, but ultimately felt the article relied too much on anecdata. I’m unconvinced that rising defaults look anything like the GFC given the size of the overall market ($1.47T per the article) which is just 1/10th of what the mortgage debt market was in 2008. 

Rising defaults on car loans makes a lot of sense given the circumstances of the purchase and current economic conditions. Cars got really, really expensive in the past two years due to supply constraints, and consumers that took out loans to buy these vehicles now face extreme inflation in a lot of necessities. Even if they saw a large wage increase in 2021, there has been a deep negative shock to real wages in 2022.

Yesterday, Shopify CEO announced a round of layoffs in [this post](https://news.shopify.com/changes-to-shopifys-team). Tobi admits that the pandemic created a real resource misallocation and right now we are seeing this unwind. I think this is the key to understand what the economy is currently going through on its way to recession (or maybe not?). The resource misallocation in Covid was the rapid transition to online and deceleration of brick and mortar. This was heavily experienced in e-commerce but also streaming, home fitness and other industries catering to WFH trends. These industries saw a ‘pulling forward’ of revenue due to the rapid increase in the transition of customers to these products. American business took the bet that Covid was fundamentally changing society by rapidly accelerating the slow change we were experiencing prior to covid—and businesses were wrong. No, it was not different this time.

>When the Covid pandemic set in, almost all retail shifted online because of shelter-in-place orders. Demand for Shopify skyrocketed. To help merchants, we threw away our roadmaps and shipped everything that could possibly be helpful. It was hard, but we know for a fact that more merchants’ businesses survived the pandemic because of the work we did in this time and that’s exactly what our mission is about.

>Shopify has always been a company that makes the big strategic bets our merchants demand of us - this is how we succeed. Before the pandemic, ecommerce growth had been steady and predictable. Was this surge to be a temporary effect or a new normal? And so, given what we saw, we placed another bet: We bet that the channel mix - the share of dollars that travel through ecommerce rather than physical retail - would permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years. We couldn’t know for sure at the time, but we knew that if there was a chance that this was true, we would have to expand the company to match.

>It’s now clear that bet didn’t pay off. What we see now is the mix reverting to roughly where pre-Covid data would have suggested it should be at this point. Still growing steadily, but it wasn’t a meaningful 5-year leap ahead. Our market share in ecommerce is a lot higher than it is in retail, so this matters. Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust. As a consequence, we have to say goodbye to some of you today and I’m deeply sorry for that.

It’s always easier to recognize unsustainable trends in hindsight. The chart of e-commerce adoption in Tobi’s post should have been a massive red flag but was seen as a signal. Were Shopify and others wrong for ramping up employment to meet customer demand? Probably not. While layoffs are inevitably bad for those affected, the ability to wind down the rapid expansion relatively easy is a good thing for businesses. The economy’s rapid movements are good for consumers during expansion, but can be bad for labor in periods of contraction. 

But we shouldn’t end this discussion by accepting the bad outcomes for the labor market participants adversely affected by these violent economic swings. The current adjustment period (not a recession, or maybe it is) reminds me of the policy suggestions from a book I read earlier in the year: The Wall and the Bridge. Rather than punishing businesses for making bets on the future as Shopify did, the government should be the bridge for the members of society who experience the bad outcomes of a dynamic economy—expanded unemployment insurance that encourages re-entry into the labor market, paid job training or education that helps workers gain new skills that will help them not only get a new job but higher wages.

Having policies that make labor market transitions easier would make the boom and bust cycle less demoralizing for individuals and easier for business owners to make big bets on the future. Knowing the government will be the backstop to protect its citizens would be a win for both workers and businesses. The current cycle is full of both bad and good economic data, which makes betting on the future difficult for business. It’s important to remember the many people that will be negatively affected by a slowdown and a reminder that a bad outcome doesn’t have to be the default setting. We can and should try to improve outcomes where possible.

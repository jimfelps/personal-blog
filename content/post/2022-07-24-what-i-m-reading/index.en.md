[No, MMT Didn't Wreck Sri Lanka](https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/p/no-mmt-didnt-wreck-sri-lanka)

As an MMT-curious reader, I enjoy reading more about MMT because I think it is a coherent explanation for our extremely complicated monetary system. 

Sri Lanka used the IMF model for economic growth which meant a focus on four pillars:

1. Tourism
2. Remittances
3. FDI
4. Exports

“Here is how these engines constitute a trap. An increase in tourism induces more food and energy imports. An increase in remittances means more brain drain. An increase in low value-added exports induces more imports of capital, intermediate goods, fuel etc.; and an increase in low value-added FDI does the same plus the repatriation of profits out of Sri Lanka.”

Regarding money printing being the cause of inflation, the Bloomberg writer makes two mistakes: First, the central bank does not *directly* control the money supply. Money supply is determined by the players within the economy (banks, consumers, etc). Second, inflation is not caused by increasing money supply it’s caused by imports via food and energy. the higher the external balance, the higher the pressure on exchange rate, the higher the inflation pressure from imported goods. 

The solution to this problem lies in fiscal, not monetary policy. Fiscal policy can be used for investment in projects that boost the national productive capacity and enforce antitrust laws.

“In fact, raising interest rates can often fuel inflation (and inequality) because it is the equivalent of an income subsidy to bond holders, and a tax on actual investors who might be discouraged from increasing productive capacity.”

hmm…I suppose the argument from MMT is that productive capacity is the primary driver for inflation. Supply constraints will always be the cause for increases in the general price level. Money supply can increase as long as productive capacity is also increased in step, so a rate increase will make the cost of capital needed to increase the national productive capacity more expensive therefore the demand for capital will decrease. At the same time income for bond holders will be increased which can lead to inflation if the bond holders spend their additional income. I *think* this is the argument.

From the Bloomberg article: “proponents of MMT will likely say that this was not real MMT, or that Sri Lanka is not a sovereign country as long as it has any foreign debt.”

Sri Lanka's government ignored structural weakness, abusive market power, has a corrupt govt, and didn’t invest in food and energy. These are the biggest factors for their failure. Bad agricultural policy meant higher food imports when they didn't have the foreign reserves to pay for the imports. Food exports were then destroyed by this policy change just as the global food crisis started. Better ag policy would focus on food sovereignty centered around native seeds, discouraged intensive monoculture farming, invested in regenerative farming to undo damage to the soil, and supported farmers to increase yields “with well defined medium and long-term strategies”.

This portion makes sense. Focus on policies that increase the productive capacity of the country. So if you’re a farming nation, the government invests in increasing your farming output. The Bloomberg article highlights the govt corruption well and puts blame to this corrupt regime, but still chooses to export the majority of the blame to MMT. Highlighting how many high ranking members of the government are relatives to the president is a big red flag

[Learning Calc at 65](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/teaching-myself-calculus-at-sixty-five?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

Quick read that was fun. Don’t really have many takeaways but it is interesting to read about someone who was bad at math at a young age come back to it later in life. I wasn’t bad at math when I was younger but I wasn’t motivated to learn beyond what was on the test. This led me to reading the bare minimum to answer weekly homework. It worked well enough to get through higher math classes in college, but I never had comprehensive knowledge about the subject and I think that led me to struggle in higher econ classes in college. 

I read the book ‘The Joy of X’ earlier this year, which presented a simple overview of math from basic counting all the way through calculus and I wish I would have had access to this book when I was younger and had teachers/professors like Steven Strogatz. I don’t say this to degrade any of my math teachers over the years. I don’t have a negative opinion about any of them. I think the book made me realize how difficult it is to teach math. Making sense of numbers isn’t easy.

> A number would appear to be as simple as a letter—both are serial implements—but letters are literal and numbers have esoteric attributes. If I write the letter “A,” it is the letter “A.” It doesn’t represent something, it is something. If I write “4,” though, it isn’t “4” in the sense that “A” is “A.” “A” is concrete, the manifestation of a sound, but “4” is a symbol, a term denoting a 
collection. It has no scale or identity. It can be four cats or four galaxies. I can write “4,” but I can’t say that it *is* “4,” at least not all the possible embodiments of “4.” I can demonstrate “4” only obliquely, by gathering four things—“AAAA,” for example.

[Maximizing EV of a Lottery Ticket](https://chance.amstat.org/2020/02/lottery-ticket/)

Under the current lottery system of independent generation, players of Powerball can expect positive EV with jackpots between $775M and $1.6B, with maximal return around $1B. 

I came across this article after spending time with some friends and getting on the topic of buying lottery tickets. We wondered when the expected value of your winnings became larger than the price paid for a ticket. I didn’t consider that multiple people could win the jackpot during our discussion, but the current system for quick picks lends itself to ‘collisions’ (tickets with same combinations) occurring frequently since the machines at any particular convenience store have no knowledge of the tickets generated at other stores. There are 292,201,338 combinations for Powerball but there’s a high likelihood that a machine in Lee’s Summit will generate a ticket with the same values as a store in Overland Park before the total number of tickets purchased equals 292,201,338 since there’s no central server preventing duplicates. Further, self-selected combinations will lead to even more collisions since humans aren’t selecting numbers at random.

[3AC Speaks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-22/three-arrows-founders-en-route-to-dubai-describe-ltcm-moment)

I can't help myself when it comes to crypto...

Three events highlighted by Su Zhu (Kyle Davies isn’t quoted much in the article, just at the end) were the downfall of the fund:

1. Terra Luna collapse—stablecoin collapse that caused users to lose essentially all money invested in the platform
2. BTC falling from $30k to $20k in a week
3. GBTC abitrage trade falling apart—large investors would buy shares of GBTC by giving BTC to the trust and then selling the shares on the secondary market 6 months later. Since the shares traded at a premium to BTC’s actual price, 3AC could make a quick buck. The premium disappeared in early 2021 and now the shares trade at a discount. Funds like 3AC lost a lot of money when this occurred since they were required to hold the shares for 6 months before selling. 

I’ve seen a lot of dunking on 3AC on Twitter and I’m not convinced it’s all deserved. Sure, it appears that their entire strategy was built around extreme leverage, but is that not common in the world of hedge funds? A lot of the criticism revolves around the simplicity of the trades—stETH and Terra Luna, but this is more a criticism of the crypto ecosystem rather than 3AC. 3AC failed to see the crypto market downturn coming, which happens with traditional hedge funds too. I think the real story here is the lack of risk management at the creditors of 3AC. How were they able to borrow so much money?

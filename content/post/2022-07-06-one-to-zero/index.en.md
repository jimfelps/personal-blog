Peter Thiel’s Zero to One was book #6 for me in 2022 and I was never able to get around to writing much about the book like I have with the others. Reading about the recent collapse of crypto funds and how these firms attempted to adapt Thiel’s strategy to the world of finance has given an opportunity to reflect on why I think the Zero to One strategy is not well suited for the finance industry.

The Zero to One strategy can be summarized as spending on customer acquisition at all costs to build monopoly power. Aswath Damodaran has characterized this strategy as the ‘Field of Dreams’ narrative in his valuation of Amazon. If you build it (revenue), they (profits) will come. This strategy has been the key of Silicon Valley VC’s and had its glory days in the 2010’s, when we had a long runway of cheap money that gave investors a perfect environment to pour investment into ventures that burned cash at epic rates. The recent blow up of Celsius and other crypto lenders also brings out the ‘Ponzinomics’ of this venture strategy. Early stage investors are able to prop up valuations of their positions in later rounds. If there’s a VC willing to fund, the company can continue their money losing operations—a strategy facilitated by loose monetary policy to create enormous amounts of wealth, particularly among the already wealthy.

For industries such as finance, the Zero to One model is dangerous and will lead to many people losing money. We’re seeing this now in the crypto lending blow up mentioned above. While Blockfi found bailout funding from FTX, companies like Celsius, Anchor, Voyager, Babel and Coinflex have all frozen account withdraws. Normally, a lender would adjust deposit returns based on lending demand but a finance company adopting a Zero to One strategy would maintain high deposit returns, even when loan demand remained low, on the promise of future returns—the functional equivalent of Uber pricing a ride below actual cost and financing the rest with investor (but in this case, user) money. These companies maintained extremely high interest rates on accounts while they failed to see demand for loans grow—likely because they were expensive products and required overcollateralization in exchange for anonymity. 

In non-financial industries, this business model exists and works where scale economies are present. A large car company can run big efficient factories that produce cars much cheaper than a boutique startup operation. The millionth marginal car has a much lower cost than the hundredth. But a 20% unlevered yield, in a world where treasuries yield 2-3% and risky junk bonds yield 10%, is not easier to pay your depositors at scale. It just increases the rate of new deposits you need to meet outflows unless the VC subsidy keeps growing exponentially. Obtaining all of the depositors and then lowering yields until they’re economical doesn’t work here. There are other yield things and depositors can just leave. 

In the end, these businesses were all taken down by the collapse of Bitcoin and other crypto products, leaving their loan books undercollateralized and spooked depositors heading for the doors.

As an aside, I find the framing of client money as ‘depositor’ funds elicits a feeling of frustration in me. These businesses are nothing more than unregulated banks, so their products invoke thoughts of bank-like products, which are insured to a certain point, making it equal to cash in terms of risk. Opening an account at Celsius and then converting your USD to a ‘stablecoin’ that is redeemable for $1 at anytime* and then collecting interest for holding that digital token smells like a savings account and I think it’s wrong these products don’t come with very explicit warnings that the consumer is not depositing money into a bank. Users are warned to do their own due diligence (at best), a request that I believe consumers are extremely ill-prepared to do with legacy financial products and even more ill-prepared with new digital products. At worse, [account holders at Voyager were told their funds were FDIC insured](https://www.theblock.co/post/156065/despite-voyagers-claims-its-bank-says-fdic-insurance-will-not-protect-customer-usd-deposits-from-firms-bankruptcy), an outright lie.

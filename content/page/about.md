title: About me
---

I'm currently a financial analyst at a metal buildings manufacturer supporting the engineering and sales teams by preparing monthly and ad hoc analysis to guide strategy decisions. I spent the 2.5 years designing and implementing a sales and operations planning group and currently lead the bi-monthly meeting with a cross-functional team of business leaders with the purpose of connecting the sales team with production leaders to align demand capacity with market indicators.

I've spent 9 years and many roles at the company and the most enjoyable aspect of any role has been finding ways to leave it better than I found. Finding ways to automate repetitive reports opens up time for projects that are interesting, help me to understand the business better, and provide value to the company end up being win-wins for both sides.

In my free time, I help raise a daughter (10) and son (4) with my wife of 11 years. I enjoy running and playing music in my free time. I first started playing trombone in 5th grade and bass guitar in high school. I play the bass at our church once a month as an outlet.

title: About me
---

I'm currently a financial analyst at Bluescope Buildings North America supporting the enigneering and sales teams by preparing monthly and ad hoc analysis by delivering necessary reporting to guide strategy decisions. I spent the past year designing and implementing a sales and operations planning group and currently lead the bi-monthly meeting with a cross-functional team of business leaders with the purpose of connecting the sales team with production leaders to algin demand capacity with market indicators.

I've spent 7 years and many roles at Bluescope and the most enjoyable aspect of any role has been finding ways to leave it better than I found. Finding ways to automate repetitive reports to open up time for projects that are interesting, help me to understand the business better, and provide value to the company end up being win-wins for both sides.

In my free time, I help raise a daughter (8) and son (2) with my wife of 9 years. I enjoy running in my time before and after the kids' bedtime, and occationally convince my daughter to join me. I also enjoy playing music. I first started playing trombone in 5th grade and transferred my bass clef knowledge to the electric bass in high school. I play the electric bass at our church one a month as an outlet.

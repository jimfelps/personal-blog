      <description>Quick note—most of the polling numbers I use below are the most recent readings. A lot of the most recent polling numbers increased significantly in favor of abortion.
Looking through Gallup polling data, it becomes clear about a quarter of the way through that the question of “are you pro-choice?” is much more nuanced than many people might recognize at first. When the news surfaced a month ago that SCOTUS was overturning Roe, many people jumped on the headline polling number that a majority of Americans supported the right of women to choose.</description>

      <description>While trying to figure out what content to include on this site, I decided it might be best to start re-creating visualizations found online. I looked through the subreddit /r/dataisbeautiful to find a visualization, and specifically one done in a language other than R, that I found appealing and the subject matter interesting. I look at this subreddit a few times each month and love the work that people post. I like that this subreddit contains visualizations from people that have been perfecting their craft for years and people just starting out.</description>

      <description>The picture above several weeks ago at Smithville Lake. Since the lockdown, one of my family’s biggest challenges has been to keep our kids active while also being safe. We don’t have a boat to get out on the lake, but through a friend we were able to find a secluded beach where we can bring some snacks, relax in a beach chair, and float on the lake for a few hours.</description>
